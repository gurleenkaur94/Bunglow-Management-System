Tools used:
HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage. I used it for creating headings, format paragraphs, control line breaks, make lists, emphasize text, create special characters, insert images, create links, build tables, control some styling.
CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used for the design of a webpage â€“ where everything is placed and how it looks. 
JavaScript is used to define the interactive elements of a webpage that help to engage users.
